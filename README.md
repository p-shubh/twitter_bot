# Twitter Bot for Tracking Word "Netsepio"

## Overview
This project is a Twitter bot designed to track tweets containing the word "Netsepio" and fetch information from those tweets. It's implemented in Go and utilizes the Twitter API to search for tweets and extract relevant data.

## Features
- **Tracking**: The bot continuously monitors Twitter for tweets containing the specified keyword.
- **Data Extraction**: It extracts information such as the tweet text, user information, timestamps, etc.
- **Customization**: The bot can be customized to track other keywords or extract additional information as needed.

## Requirements
- Go 1.16 or higher
- [anaconda](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda) library for accessing the Twitter API

## Setup
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `go get`:
   ```
   go get github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda
   ```
3. Obtain Twitter API credentials by creating a Twitter Developer account and creating an application. You'll need the following credentials:
   - Consumer Key
   - Consumer Secret
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret
4. Replace the placeholder values in the `config.go` file with your actual Twitter API credentials.

## Usage
1. Build the project:
   ```
   go build -o twitter_bot
   ```
2. Run the compiled binary:
   ```
   ./twitter_bot
   ```
3. The bot will start searching for tweets containing the specified keyword ("Netsepio" in this case).
4. Retrieved tweets will be displayed in the console along with relevant information extracted from each tweet.

## Customization
- Modify the `TRACK_KEYWORD` constant in `config.go` to track a different keyword.
- Extend the `processTweet()` function in `twitter_bot.go` to extract additional information from tweets.
